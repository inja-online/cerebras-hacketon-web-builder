    The design follows a minimalist, dark-themed aesthetic, emphasizing clarity and a modern feel. The color palette is intentionally muted, utilizing shades of zinc and nearly black for backgrounds and primary elements, with a slightly lighter zinc for accents and borders. This creates a subtle contrast, ensuring readability without being visually overwhelming. Text is primarily white or a muted gray, further contributing to the clean and understated look. The chosen font, Inter, is a sans-serif known for its legibility on screens, reinforcing the focus on content and usability.

    Component styling is consistent with the minimalist approach. Elements like textareas and buttons feature rounded corners, subtle borders, and soft transitions on hover or focus, providing gentle visual feedback. Spacing is generous, achieved through Tailwind's utility classes, which helps in creating a balanced and uncluttered layout. The overall design prioritizes a clean, unobtrusive user interface, allowing the content and user interaction to be the primary focus.
